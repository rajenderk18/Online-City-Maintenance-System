# AVIYAT â€“ A Platform for Grievance Reporting for City Maintenance

> Online City Maintenance System is one of a kind, offering simple, yet powerful maintenance management for common issues related to city. City and municipal maintenance is not a small task for any locality, small or large. When a municipal pipe starts leaking or bursts, it's an emergency that can potentially put people at risk. When a block of streetlights go out, the area they are meant to illuminate feels less safe. These are just a couple examples of the reactive emergency repairs that public works officials must respond to and organize, saying nothing of the planned works that come into play.
